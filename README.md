Pears0's awesome config - Experimental branch.

This may not work as this is the working code base and is often
untested. Please use the beta, or master for a more reliable config.

Thanks to Talumo for allowing me to use / reference his config whilst
workling on this.

His config is available here:

To configure default programs edit config.lua.

Hope you enjoy.
